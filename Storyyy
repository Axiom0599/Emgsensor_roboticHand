During a highly competitive summer program, my team embarked on a project centered around developing an exogloveâ€”an innovative wearable device created to aid users in monitoring and optimizing their muscle activation during physical activities. The primary goal was to enhance performance and provide valuable insights to the users.
Our exoglove utilized electromyography (EMG) sensors to capture analog data from the user's muscles. This data was then recorded and stored, allowing users to track their progress over time. To display real-time information, we incorporated an OLED screen that fit comfortably on the user's wrist, resembling a watch.
We also had an ambitious idea of implementing a servo motor mechanism within the exoglove to assist with finger movements. This feature aimed to provide gentle resistance, which could have been beneficial for injured sports enthusiasts. However, due to the limited torque capacity of the servo motor, we were unable to fully implement this concept.
Nonetheless, we didn't let that deter us from exploring additional exciting elements for our project. As an intriguing addition, we created an external robotic arm using cardboard and strings. This arm had the capability to mimic the user's hand gestures by analyzing their EMG values, adding an extra dimension of interaction to our exoglove project.
