Our original idea was to build an Exoglove. It is a wearable device designed to assist users in monitoring and optimizing their muscle activation during physical activities. Our device incorporates EMG (electromyography) sensors that capture analog data from the user's muscles. Along with that, it incorporates a servo motor mechanism that assists finger movements. It uses the EMG data analysis to guide the finger movement patterns of the user. By providing gentle resistance or assistance, the Exoglove helps injured individuals recover more quickly by preventing further strain or injury to their muscles. The Exoglove records and stores the collected EMG data over time. This allows users to monitor their progress, track improvements in muscle activation, and make informed decisions about their training or rehabilitation programs. The analogue data collected by the EMG sensors is processed and analyzed in real-time. The signals are converted into digital format. It is also equipped with multiple EMG sensors strategically placed on the glove's surface. These sensors detect the electrical signals generated by the user's muscles during movement.


Materials Required.

Wearable Glove: A flexible and comfortable glove that can accommodate the electronic components and EMG sensors. It should be made of a breathable and durable material.

EMG Sensors: EMG sensors are essential for capturing the electrical signals generated by the user's muscles. These sensors should be designed specifically for EMG signal detection and can be either dry electrodes or gel-based electrodes.

Servo Motors: The Exoglove incorporates servo motors to assist finger movements. We will need high-quality servo motors that are capable of precise control and can be attached to the glove in a way that allows for smooth finger movement.

Microcontroller: A microcontroller acts as the brain of the Exoglove, processing the data from the EMG sensors and controlling the servo motors. 

Analog-to-Digital Converter (ADC)

Power Supply: Battery / Power adapter

Circuitry and Wiring

Enclosure: To protect the electronic components and ensure user comfort. This enclosure is lightweight, ergonomic, and allow easy access to the components for maintenance or modifications.


#updated EXPERIENCE

My team worked on a project centered around developing an exogloveâ€”an innovative wearable device created to aid users in monitoring and optimizing their muscle activation during physical activities. The primary goal was to enhance performance and provide valuable insights to the users.
Our exoglove utilized electromyography (EMG) sensors to capture analog data from the user's muscles. This data was then recorded and stored, allowing users to track their progress over time. To display real-time information, we incorporated an OLED screen that fit comfortably on the user's wrist, resembling a watch.
We also had an ambitious idea of implementing a servo motor mechanism within the exoglove to assist with finger movements. This feature aimed to provide gentle resistance, which could have been beneficial for injured sports enthusiasts. However, due to the limited torque capacity of the servo motor, we were unable to fully implement this concept.
Nonetheless, we didn't let that deter us from exploring additional exciting elements for our project. As an intriguing addition, we created an external robotic arm using cardboard and strings. This arm had the capability to mimic the user's hand gestures by analyzing their EMG values, adding an extra dimension of interaction to our exoglove project.
