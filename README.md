Well at least this was the original idea. We made something else.




Exoglove


The Exoglove is a wearable device designed to assist users in monitoring and optimizing their muscle activation during physical activities. Our device incorporates EMG (electromyography) sensors that capture analog data from the user's muscles.

Servo Motor Assistance: The Exoglove incorporates a servo motor mechanism that assists finger movements. It uses the EMG data analysis to guide the finger movement patterns of the user. By providing gentle resistance or assistance, the Exoglove helps injured individuals recover more quickly by preventing further strain or injury to their muscles.

Data Monitoring and Tracking: The Exoglove records and stores the collected EMG data over time. This allows users to monitor their progress, track improvements in muscle activation, and make informed decisions about their training or rehabilitation programs.

Signal Processing: The analogue data collected by the EMG sensors is processed and analyzed in real-time. The signals are converted into digital format.

EMG Sensor Data Acquisition: The Exoglove is equipped with multiple EMG sensors strategically placed on the glove's surface. These sensors detect the electrical signals generated by the user's muscles during movement.







Materials Required.

Wearable Glove: A flexible and comfortable glove that can accommodate the electronic components and EMG sensors. It should be made of a breathable and durable material.

EMG Sensors: EMG sensors are essential for capturing the electrical signals generated by the user's muscles. These sensors should be designed specifically for EMG signal detection and can be either dry electrodes or gel-based electrodes.

Servo Motors: The Exoglove incorporates servo motors to assist finger movements. We will need high-quality servo motors that are capable of precise control and can be attached to the glove in a way that allows for smooth finger movement.

Microcontroller: A microcontroller acts as the brain of the Exoglove, processing the data from the EMG sensors and controlling the servo motors. 

Analog-to-Digital Converter (ADC)

Power Supply: Battery / Power adapter

Circuitry and Wiring

Enclosure: To protect the electronic components and ensure user comfort. This enclosure is lightweight, ergonomic, and allow easy access to the components for maintenance or modifications.
